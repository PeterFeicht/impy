mini Impedance Spectrometer

For detailed description of options see 'help options'.
For a guide on how to select range settings see 'help ranges'.
See 'help eth' and 'help usb' for Ethernet and USB commands, respectively.
See 'help setup' for information on how to use the setup command.

When a command is preceded by an '@' character, echo is disabled for this line.
This is useful for non-interactive communication, where it is undesirable that
sent characters are echoed back.

help options:
Options for 'board set' and 'board get' commands:
  --start           Set the start frequency of a sweep in Hz [default: 10k]
                    For the valid range see 'board info'
  --stop            Set the stop frequency of a sweep in Hz [default: 100k]
                    For the valid range see 'board info'
Note that when setting start and stop frequency in a single command, an error
can occur when the new start frequency is equal to or higher than the previous
stop frequency. In this case you need to change the order in which start and
stop options appear on the command line.
  --steps           Set the number of frequency steps in a sweep, that is the
                    number of times the frequency is incremented [default: 50]

                    This is always transferred as formatted floating point text

help eth:
TODO Ethernet interface is not implemented yet.

Commands:
  set --dhcp    Enable or disable automatic IP configuration [default: on]
  set --ip      Manually set an IP address in the format 192.168.2.1/24
                Note that this has no effect if DHCP is enabled
  status        Print Ethernet interface status information
  enable        Enable Ethernet interface [default: enabled]
  disable       Disable Ethernet interface

help usb:
TODO USB host is not implemented yet.

Commands:
  status    Print USB status information
  info      Print USB device information, if a device is plugged in
  eject     Unmount a USB device before unplugging
  write     Write current measurement data to specified file on USB device
  delete    Delete the specified file from the USB device
  ls        List files on USB device

help format:
Measurement data can be transferred in a number of different formats,
depending on how the data will be processed. Possible format specifications
consist of several format flags combined:
  A/B     ASCII or binary transfer
  C/P     Cartesian (real and imaginary parts) or polar (magnitude and angle)
  H       Print a header line (ASCII) or transfer byte count (binary)
  F/X     ASCII only: formatted floating point or raw hexadecimal
  S/T/D   ASCII only: values separated by space, tab or comma
Note that polar representation is the native format (and therefore faster).

Binary format: data is sent in big endian binary (MSB is sent first).
  If the H flag is set, the number of bytes is sent as a 32 bit unsigned
  integer. The frequency is also a 32 bit unsigned integer. Magnitude and angle
  or real and imaginary part are transferred as single precision floating point
  values (32 bits).

ASCII format: data is sent in human readable form, one line per record.
  The separator character between frequency and magnitude/angle or
  real/imaginary part can be set with the S, T and D flags. After the last
  record, two line breaks are sent to signal the end of transmission.

help settl:
The number of settling cycles determines how many excitation cycles are output
before an impedance conversion is made. The valid range is 0..511 and can be
extended 2 or 4 times by specifying a multiplier like 'x2'.
Valid values would be '20' or '40x2', but not '512' (use '256x2' instead).

help voltage:
The AD5933 can output four different voltage ranges: 2V, 1V, 400mV and 200mV.
For small impedances a small voltage is used to keep the flowing current small
as well. Additionally, there is an external attenuator which can attenuate the
output voltage of the AD5933 by certain values, allowing smaller effective
output voltages for measuring very small impedances.
For possible attenuations see 'board info'.
The specified voltage needs to be one of the four AD5933 voltage ranges,
divided by the possible attenuations.

help autorange:
  TODO Autoranging is not implemented yet.

help calibrate:
Before measurements can be made the system has to be calibrated with a known
impedance. After the range settings (start and stop frequency, output voltage,
feedback resistor or PGA gain) are changed, the 'board calibrate' command is
used to do that. The calibration impedance should be in the same range as the
impedance to be measured for accurate results.
A recalibration should also be performed when the ambient temperature changes
significantly.

help ranges:
The AD5933 outputs a known voltage and measures the current through the unknown
impedance by means of a current-to-voltage amplifier. The following procedure
can be used to select the proper ranges:
 * Set the output voltage low enough, that the output current does not exceed
   10mA with the lowest impedance expected.
 * Set the current feedback resistor to a value low enough, that the input
   voltage stays below 3V for the highest output current expected.
 * If necessary, the PGA can be set to x5 gain to further amplify the input
   voltage when high impedances are to be measured. For accurate results, the
   input signal should be close to 3V for the lowest impedance expected.

help echo:
By default, all characters received on the virtual COM port (VCP) are echoed
back, so you can see what you type. However, when the device is configured by
scripts or programs, this may be undesirable. Therefore, the echoing can be
disabled either completely (board set --echo=off) or just for single lines, by
preceding them with an '@' character.
If echo is disabled globally, the '@' character has no effect and is ignored.

help setup:
The EEPROM stores configuration information for the board, such as populated
feedback or calibration resistors, Ethernet MAC address and populated
peripherals. The setup command is used to set these configuration options when
the board is used for the first time. If no EEPROM is fitted, this command has
no effect.

Commands:
  attenuation <value>...        Possible output voltage attenuations, at most
                                4 values
  feedback <ohms>...            Fitted feedback resistors, at most 8 values
  calibration <ohms>...         Fitted calibration resistors, at most 6 values
  coupl <tau>                   Coupling capacitor time constant in ms
  sram (on|off) [<size>]        Whether external SRAM memory is fitted and, if
                                so, the size in bytes
  flash (on|off) [<size>]       Whether external flash memory is fitted and, if
                                so, the size in bytes
  eth (on|off) [<mac-address>]  Whether the Ethernet interface is fitted and,
                                if so, the MAC address to be used in the format
                                "12:34:56:78:9A:BC" or "12-34-56-78-9A-BC"
  usbh (on|off)                 Whether the USB host jack is fitted

For attenuations and feedback and calibration resistors, the order on the
command line is the same as for the respective ports in ascending order.
For example, if feedback port 0 has a 10k resistor and port 1 a 100k resistor,
the corresponding command line would be 'setup feedback 10k 100k'.
Values that are not populated can also be set to 0, for example
'setup attenuation 1 100 0 0'.
