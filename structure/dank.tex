\chapter{Acknowledgment}

First of all I want to thank my supervisor DI Stefan Clara for his support and for the opportunity to work on a, more
or less, real world project, where I could combine the two things I like most about electronics: circuit design and
programming.

A big thank you also goes out to my father Klaus, who continues to enable my studies and my life in Linz, despite
him having to support four kids.
I know I'm not always easy to deal with and I'm very grateful for your support and love.
