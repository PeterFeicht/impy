\chapter{Hardware} \label{sec:hardware}

This chapter will describe the hardware design of the device.

Starting point is the \emph{AD5933} by Analog Devices, an impedance converter IC that includes a digital-to-analog and
analog-to-digital converter, DSP engine for discrete time Fourier transform and internal clock source. It can output
frequencies in the range of \unit{10}{\hertz} to \unit{100}{\kilo\hertz} with the use of external clock sources.
A block diagram can be seen in \autoref{fig:ad_block}.

    and an impedance that is measured, respectively.}

For controlling the chip and interfacing with the PC, the \emph{STM32F4 Discovery} board by ST (see \autoref{fig:stm32})
is used. This is built around an STM32F407 microcontroller, includes two USB ports (one for programming and one for use
by the microcontroller), a programmer with debugging features and a clock source and exposes most of the microcontroller
pins on two $ 2 \times 25 $ pin headers. There are also some other peripherals which are not used for this project.

The whole device consists of a single PCB onto which the STM32F4 Discovery board is mounted. This board has connections
for the measured impedances, a power supply jack as well as a header where calibration resistors are mounted.


\section{Analog Front End (AFE)}

The AD5933 has some severe limitations concerning its output and the load that can be placed there. Without additional
circuitry, the range is limited to at least a few \unit{100}{\kilo\ohm} up to \unit{10}{\mega\ohm}.
Since the desired range is down to about \unit{10}{\ohm}, and more than one impedance should be measured at once,
an external analog front end needs to be used.

A block diagram of the external AFE can be seen in \autoref{fig:schem_afe}. There are four analog multiplexers
(dual ADG725 by Analog Devices, M1 in the schematic) that connect multiple unknown and calibration impedances in a
four-wire arrangement, to cancel out the on-resistance of the multiplexers. Multiplexer M2 is used to attenuate the
output voltage of the AD5933, this is needed to measure small impedances so the output current is kept small.
