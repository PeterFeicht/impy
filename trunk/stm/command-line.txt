STRINGIFY((
mini Impedance Spectrometer
This device is configured entirely by command line, however measurement data
can be transferred in a binary fashion as well.
Below you will find all commands currently understood, they are all case
sensitive. Most settings made will be saved in memory on-board.

Commands:
  board set [--start=FREQ] [--stop=FREQ] [--steps=NUM]
  board set [--settl=CYCLES] [--voltage=RANGE] [--gain=(on|off)]
  board set [--format=FMT] [--autorange=(on|off)] [--echo=(on|off)]
  board (info | get <option>)
  board (start <port> | stop | status | temp | measure <port> <freq>)
  board read [--format=FMT]
  eth set [--dhcp=(on|off)] [--ip=IP]
  eth (status | enable | disable)
  usb (status | info | eject | write <file> | ls)
  help [<topic>]

Options:
  --start=FREQ      Set the start frequency of a sweep in Hz [default: 1000]
                    The valid range is 10..100000
  --stop=FREQ       Set the stop frequency of a sweep in Hz [default: 100000]
                    The valid range is 10..100000
  --steps=NUM       Set the number of frequency points in a sweep [default: 50]
                    The valid range is 1..511
  --settl=CYCLES    Set the number of settling cycles [default: TODO]
                    The valid range is TODO, see also 'help settl'
  --voltage=RANGE   Set the output voltage range [default: 1]
                    Valid voltages are 0.2, 0.4, 1, 2. See also 'help voltage'
  --gain            Enable or disable the x5 input gain stage [default: off]
  --format=FMT      Set the output format of measurement data [default: APFHS]
                    For possible formats see 'help format'
  --autorange       Enable or disable auto-ranging [default: on]
                    For more information see 'help autorange'
  --echo            Enable or disable echo of received characters [default: on]
                    For more information see 'help echo'

Commands:
  set           Set option(s) to specified value(s)
  get           Print current value of specified option
  info          Print status information for the whole board
  start <port>  Start a frequency sweep on specified port
  stop          Stop a running frequency sweep
  status        Print measurement status information
  temp          Measure and print the AD5933 chip temperature
  measure       Measure and print a single frequency point on specified port
  read          Transfer measurement data (with optional format specification)
                For possible formats see 'help format'

See 'help eth' and 'help usb' for Ethernet and USB commands, respectively.

When a command is preceded by an '@' character, echo is disabled for this line.
This is useful for non-interactive communication, where '@board set --echo=off'
can be sent to disable echo without the command itself being echoed.

help eth:
TODO

Options:
  set --dhcp    Enable or disable automatic IP configuration [default: on]
  set --ip      Manually set an IP address in the format 192.168.2.1/24
  status        Print Ethernet interface status information
  enable        Enable Ethernet interface [default: enabled]
  disable       Disable Ethernet interface


help usb:
TODO

Options:
  status    Print USB status information
  info      Print USB device information, if a device is plugged in
  eject     Unmount a USB device before unplugging
  write     Write current measurement data to specified file on USB device
  ls        List files on USB device


help format:
Measurement data can be transferred in a number of different formats,
depending on how the data will be processed. Possible format specifications
consist of several format flags combined:
  A/B     ASCII or binary transfer (MSB first)
  C/P     Cartesian (real and imaginary parts) or polar (magnitude and angle)
  H       Print a header line (ASCII) or transfer byte count (binary, 2 bytes)
  F/X     ASCII only: formatted floating point or raw hexadecimal
  S/T/D   ASCII only: values separated by space, tab or comma


help settl:
  TODO


help voltage:
  TODO


help autorange:
  TODO


help echo:
  By default, all characters received on the virtual COM port (VCP) are echoed
  back, so you can see what you type. However, when the device is configured by
  scripts or programs, this may be undesirable. Therefore, the echoing can be
  disabled either completely (board set --echo=off) or just for single lines,
  by preceding them with an '@' character.
  If echo is disabled globally, the '@' character has no effect and is ignored.
