mini Impedance Spectrometer
This device is configured entirely by command line, however measurement data
can be transferred in a binary fashion as well.

Commands:
  set           Set option(s) to specified value(s)
  get           Print current value of specified option
  info          Print status information for the whole board
  calibrate     Perform a calibration with the specified resistor value
                For more information see 'help calibrate'
  start         Start a frequency sweep on specified port
                For the valid port range see 'board info'
  stop          Stop a running frequency sweep
  status        Print measurement status information
  temp          Measure and print the AD5933 chip temperature
  measure       Measure and print a single frequency point on specified port
  read          Transfer measurement data (with optional format specification)
                For possible formats see 'help format'

See 'help eth' and 'help usb' for Ethernet and USB commands, respectively.

When a command is preceded by an '@' character, echo is disabled for this line.
This is useful for non-interactive communication, where '@board set --echo=off'
can be sent to disable echo without the command itself being echoed.

help eth:
TODO

Options:
  set --dhcp    Enable or disable automatic IP configuration [default: on]

  status        Print Ethernet interface status information
  enable        Enable Ethernet interface [default: enabled]
  disable       Disable Ethernet interface

help usb:
TODO

Options:
  status    Print USB status information
  info      Print USB device information, if a device is plugged in
  eject     Unmount a USB device before unplugging
  write     Write current measurement data to specified file on USB device
  ls        List files on USB device

help format:
Measurement data can be transferred in a number of different formats,
depending on how the data will be processed. Possible format specifications
consist of several format flags combined:
  A/B     ASCII or binary transfer
  C/P     Cartesian (real and imaginary parts) or polar (magnitude and angle)
  H       Print a header line (ASCII) or transfer byte count (binary)
  F/X     ASCII only: formatted floating point or raw hexadecimal
  S/T/D   ASCII only: values separated by space, tab or comma
Note that polar representation is the native format (and therefore faster).

Binary format: data is sent in big endian binary (MSB is sent first).
  If the H flag is set, the number of bytes is sent as a 32 bit unsigned
  integer. The frequency is also a 32 bit unsigned integer. Magnitude and angle
  or real and imaginary part are transferred as single precision floating point
  values (32 bits).

ASCII format: data is sent in human readable form, one line per record.
  The separator character between frequency and magnitude/angle or
  real/imaginary part can be set with the S, T and D flags. After the last
  record, two line breaks are sent to signal the end of transmission.

help settl:
The number of settling cycles determines how many excitation cycles are output
before an impedance conversion is made. The valid range is 0..511 and can be
extended by 2 or 4 times by specifying a multiplier like 'x2'.
Valid values would be '20' or '40x2', but not '512' (use '256x2' instead).

help voltage:
The AD5933 can output four different voltage ranges: 2V, 1V, 400mV and 200mV.
For small impedances a small voltage is used to keep the flowing current small
as well. Additionally, there is an external attenuator which can attenuate the
output voltage of the AD5933 by certain values, allowing smaller effective
output voltages for measuring very small impedances.
For possible attenuations see 'board info'.
The specified voltage needs to be one of the four AD5933 voltage ranges,
divided by the possible attenuations.

help echo:
By default, all characters received on the virtual COM port (VCP) are echoed
back, so you can see what you type. However, when the device is configured by
scripts or programs, this may be undesirable. Therefore, the echoing can be
disabled either completely (board set --echo=off) or just for single lines, by
preceding them with an '@' character.
If echo is disabled globally, the '@' character has no effect and is ignored.
