Bachelor's Thesis
=================

This project contains all of the stuff from my bachelor's thesis.

The goal is to create an impedance spectrometer based on the
*Impedance Converter Network Analyzer* chip [AD5933][1] from Analog Devices.

The device uses an [STM32F4 Discovery board][2] by ST for interfacing with a PC
and MATLAB for controlling the measurement parameters.
