\chapter{Hardware} \label{sec:hardware}

This chapter will describe the hardware design of the device.

Starting point is the \emph{AD5933} by Analog Devices, an impedance converter IC that includes digital-to-analog and
analog-to-digital converters, a DSP engine for discrete time Fourier transform, and an internal clock source. It can
output frequencies in the range of \unit{10}{\hertz} to \unit{100}{\kilo\hertz} with the use of external clock sources.

For controlling the chip and interfacing with the PC, the \emph{STM32F4 Discovery} board by ST (see \autoref{fig:stm32})
is used. This is built around an STM32F407 microcontroller, includes two USB ports (one for programming and one for use
by the microcontroller), a programmer with debugging features and a clock source and exposes most of the microcontroller
pins on two $ 2 \times 25 $ pin headers. There are also four user programmable LEDs, as well as some other peripherals
which are not used for this project.

    STM32F407 on the right.}

\end{figure}

The whole device consists of a single PCB onto which the STM32F4 Discovery board is mounted. This board has connections
for the impedances to be measured, a power supply jack as well as a header where calibration resistors are mounted.
A picture of the front and back side of the finished board can be seen in \autoref{fig:pcb_frontback}
(\autopageref{fig:pcb_frontback}). Aside from the fitted components described later, there are footprints and traces
for a USB host connector (to save measured data onto a USB flash drive), an Ethernet jack (for remote control over
an IP network) and two additional memory chips. These features are not yet implemented in the firmware.

\section{The AD5933}

This section will describe the AD5933 and the impedance measurement procedure in particular, a block diagram of the
AD5933 can be seen in \autoref{fig:ad_block} (\autopageref{fig:ad_block}).

    and an impedance that is measured, respectively.}

\subsection{Analog Front End (AFE)}

The AD5933 has some severe limitations concerning its output and the load that can be placed there. Without additional
circuitry, the range is limited to at least a few \unit{100}{\kilo\ohm} up to \unit{10}{\mega\ohm}.
Since the desired range is down to about \unit{10}{\ohm}, and more than one impedance should be measured at once,
an external analog front end needs to be used.

A block diagram of the external AFE can be seen in \autoref{fig:schem_afe} (\autopageref{fig:schem_afe}).
There are four analog multiplexers (dual ADG725 by Analog Devices, M1 in the schematic) that connect multiple unknown
and calibration impedances in a four-wire arrangement, to cancel out the on-resistance of the multiplexers.
Multiplexer M2 is used to attenuate the output voltage of the AD5933, this is needed when measuring small impedances,
so the output current is kept small.
