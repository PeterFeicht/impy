\chapter{User's Manual} \label{sec:manual}

This manual will describe the impedance spectrometer in detail and give step by step instructions for using it.

An overview of the device connections can be seen in \autoref{fig:device_connections}, when referring to connectors
later, the numbers from the image will be used in bold font. Connector footprints for unimplemented features are not
labeled, the push buttons on the board are the same as those on the STM32F4 Discovery board.
